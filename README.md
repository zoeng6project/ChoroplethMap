Project Description: Choropleth Map Visualization
This project aims to create an interactive choropleth map that visualizes educational attainment across U.S. counties. Utilizing the D3.js library, the map represents the percentage of adults aged 25 and older with a bachelor's degree or higher, based on data from the USDA Economic Research Service.
